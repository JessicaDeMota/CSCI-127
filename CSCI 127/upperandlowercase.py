#we need to use a variable to assign our user input
#our user needs to be able to insert any message; think of it like a chatbox
#so in this case we use the variable greeting to make a user input to insert a message
greeting = input("Put a message here to show user: ")
#we want to print our message normally
#and then we want to be able to print our string in upper case and lower case
#.lower and .upper are string handling componets in python
#it basically uses a true- false kind of ideal to be able to convert all characthers
print(greeting)
print(greeting.upper())
print(greeting.lower())
