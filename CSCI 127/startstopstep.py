#we have to import our turtle in order to be able to draw
#once our turtle has been imported we have to use start, stop, step in order to get our range
#our turtle has to move forward 25 steps
#then it must move left our index.
import turtle
mar = turtle.Turtle()
for i in range(90,0,-2):
 mar.forward(25)
 mar.left(i)
